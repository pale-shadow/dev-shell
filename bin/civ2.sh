# A helper script to manage and run Civilization II under Wine.

# ChangeLog:
#
# v0.1 02/25/2022 Maintainer script
# v0.2 06/25/2025 Used goog ai studio to make improvements

# --- Script Configuration ---
# Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.
set -e
# Treat unset variables as an error.
set -u
# The return value of a pipeline is the status of the last command to exit
# with a non-zero status, or zero if no command failed.
set -o pipefail

# --- Wine and Game Configuration ---
# Use a dedicated WINEPREFIX for the game to avoid conflicts with other apps.
# This can be overridden by setting the WINEPREFIX environment variable before running the script.
# Example: WINEPREFIX=/path/to/my/prefix ./run_civ2.sh run
WINEPREFIX="${WINEPREFIX:-$HOME/.wine_civ2}"

# Civilization II is a 32-bit application.
#readonly WINEARCH="win32"
WINEARCH="win32"

# Path to the game executable RELATIVE to the WINEPREFIX.
# Using a variable makes it easy to change if needed.
readonly GAME_PATH_IN_PREFIX="drive_c/Program Files/MPS/CIV2/CIV2.EXE"
readonly GAME_EXE_FULL_PATH="${WINEPREFIX}/${GAME_PATH_IN_PREFIX}"

# Suppress most of Wine's debug chatter for a cleaner experience.
export WINEDEBUG="-all"

# --- Functions ---

# Displays help and usage information.
